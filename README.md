We are grading your solutions on linux so we suggest that you implement the assignments on linux.
That being said you should be able to use any OS of your choise if youfollow these instructions:
- [Linux](linux.md)
- [Windows](windows.md)
- [MacOS](macos.md)

We highly recommend using an IDE such as [CLion](clion.md)
or at least a source code editor such as [VS Code](vscode.md)
